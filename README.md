## Multivariate Log-binomial (and Poisson) Regression between Years since Quitting Smoking and Self-reported Oral Health 
### A Sample of Work in SAS  
---
This folder contains a .pdf copy of my analysis of a subset of Candian Community Health Survey (CCHS) data from 2015-2016. The analysis is based on an assignment I did in graduate school, but I went back to fix a couple things and reduce some of my code.

The .pdf report shows the initial data cleaning/processes I did, or I would do, just before removing confounders from a full model.
I did not show a table of univariate statistics. I also did not show me actually removing any of the confounders from my full model (if needed), as I felt like making a fairly easy and short example. I did state what I would do at the end of my analysis however, to remove confounders (i.e., the '+-20% change in the regression coefficient of interest' rule). I believe that this step is easy/standard enough to follow.

I followed a backwards variable selection method.
